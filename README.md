# Tech-With-Tim-projects
These are various Python projects that I've made from [Tech with Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/)'s tutorials. 

Through his videos, I've learned to create object-oriented Python programs and experiment with free and open source libraries from the [Python Packaging Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI). This has included building video games using the [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) library, which is cross-platform library for building multimedia apps. By building video games, I've also learned how to solve puzzles and develop game AI using search tree algorithms. This includes building a checkers AI using alpha-beta pruning, as well as a Sudoku solver using backtracking.

I've experimented with other PyPI packages outside of pygame. For example, I looked into the [opencv-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) library for the analysis and editing of images and videos, and learned how to use this module to filter light and recognize faces from a webcam. I've also tried the [neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python) library, the Python implementation of an evolutionary algorithm using arbitrary neural networks, to generate evolving AI that learns how to beat Flappy Bird. This has grown my passion for maching learning and and wonder on how to use Python for engineering applications.
